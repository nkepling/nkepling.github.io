I am a computer science Ph.D student at Vanderbilt University where my research explores decision-making under uncertainty for real-world cyber-physical systems. I conduct research at [ScopeLab](https://scopelab.ai/) under the guidance of [Abhishek Dubey](https://abhishekdubey.bio/). 

Broadly, my research interests center on developing intelligent, adaptable, and safe decision-making algorithms that can be applied to cyber-physical systems. I care deeply about **real-world impact**, specifically in domains like medicine, public transportation, and emergency response, where improved decision-making can significantly enhance the quality of life.

To this end, my work primarily focuses on the **development of algorithms for decision making under uncertainty**, with a particular emphasis on **non-stationary environments**, where the underlying system dynamics change over time. My research spans the domains of **reinforcement learning**, **deep learning**, and **cyber-physical systems**.

Prior to starting my Ph.D. program, I earned an M.S. in Data Science from the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO. Before that, I completed a bachelor's degree in both physics and Chinese language from Trinity University in San Antonio, TX.

Outside of my research, you can find me on the mats practicing Jiu-Jitsu, playing blitz chess, or exploring the Nashville restaurant scene.
